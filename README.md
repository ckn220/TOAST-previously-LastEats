Locavore
===========

Locavore is an outlet for intensely proud native foodies to showcase their culinary experiences and preferences. Additionally, it is a great resource for those who are traveling to gain insights and recommendations from a constantly updating network of unique restaurants patroned and endorsed by residents of a region. 

Locavore ennobles natives by letting them showcase their knowledge in a collective environment. This is not TripAdvisor or an International Yelp. Both of these sites have thousands of reviews both positive and negative. Locavore is made to emphasize the restaurants that local citizens are fiercely loyal to, whether new or old, well known or not. 

Restaurants keep changing, moving, improving or falling by the wayside entirely. Guide books are incomplete at best and potentially biased at worst. Theyâ€™re updated infrequently and are often produced by a singular writer whose values in cuisine, adventure and patronage may or may not resemble your own. 

Locavore seeks users who are looking to showcase and defend the restaurants that have held significant personal or cultural importance in their lives.
